					<h5>WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBILITY <span class="chi-hong">*</span></h5>
					<p>Both entrances to Schermerhorn are equipped with wheelchair lifts, but the back entrance is the more direct route. The security guard at the booth near the entrance should have a key to the lift, but it is still a good idea to contact Security in advance of your visit. Visit the Office of Disability Services web site for more information regarding campus accessibility. Click here for more information regarding accessibility within Schermerhorn Hall. To reach the “back door” entrance to Schermerhorn Hall, at 119th St. and Amsterdam Ave., follow the above route but continue north on Riverside Drive to 120th Street. Turn right on 120th and then right at Amsterdam Avenue. The next light will be 119th Street, where you’ll find the “back door” entrance to Schermerhorn Hall.</p>
