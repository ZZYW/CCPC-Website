						<p class="english">In recent years, the communication between China and the rest of the world has achieved an unprecedented horizon, both in width and depth. During this course, China has been exploring opportunities from all over the world; at the same time, China has also been reciprocating the world with its own values and opportunities. However, inevitably, it has been full of doubts and critiques thus far. In light of such challenges, it is now vitally important to have a heart-to-heart dialogue between China and the world — How should China and the world listen to each other to achieve “win-win”? To answer this question, we hereby proudly announce the theme of 2014 Columbia China Prospects Conference (CCPC) — China’s Dialogue with the World. Refining key elements from the previous four conferences, 2014 CCPC aims to further shed light on the opportunities and challenges China may confront when it balances between its own national transformation and the international standards.</p>

						<p class="chinese">近年来，中国与世界各国交流的广度和深度有了大幅度提升。“让中国梦携手世界梦”已经不仅仅是一个愿景，而是一个正在被践行的诺言。交流之中，中国发现了来自于全世界的机遇，也为全世界创造了源自于中国的价值。然而，在此过程之中，中国也不可避免地遭遇了质疑、碰撞与挑战。此时此刻，开展一场中国与全球的深度对话，显得尤为重要 —— 如何让世界理解中国寻求共赢的声音？中国特色是否是向多元的世界体系提出了另一种可能性？有鉴于此，本届<strong>“中国展望论坛”</strong>以<strong>“聆听中国·对话全球”</strong>为主题，将着眼于发掘转型中的中国在适应并融入当今国际体系的新模式过程中所蕴含的机遇与挑战。</p>

							<h4>Entrepreneurship in China: Integrating Technology and Market 
</h4>
							<div class="row">
								<p>In the current century, rapid advances in technologies have resulted in a boom in entrepreneurship. Recently, a growing number of start-ups received venture and angel investments and became flagships in their respective industries. Foreign-educated Chinese have played a major role in contributing to the success of these companies, which, in turn, fueled a growing trend among overseas Chinese to return to China and start businesses. While IT, new energy, and biotechnology are particularly favored among start-ups, problems may arise in the process of bringing these advanced technologies from Western countries to the Chinese market. How do entrepreneurs adapt new technologies to meet the specific demands of Chinese customers? How do established Chinese firms introduce foreign technologies in order to leapfrog competitors? How do Chinese private investors evaluate novel technologies and make investment decisions? 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>We invited investors and entrepreneurs from diverse industries and geographies to join this panel to share their perspectives on the aforementioned questions.</p>

							<h4>The Future Trajectory of China’s Higher Education: Liberal Arts Education vs. 
Specialized Education</h4>
							<div class="row">
								<p>In her book Not For Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities (2010), American Philosopher Martha Nussbaum argues that the difficult choice between specialized education and a liberal arts education is a call to arms for all of the important stakeholders of a global education community. Indeed, the theme of this year’s CCPC Education Panel is pertinent not only to China, but also to the world at large. It will provide speakers with an exceptional platform for voicing their opinions, shedding light on current and future trends, and inspiring potential cross-border collaboration in the field of higher education. Needless to say, the event will be an intellectual feast for the audience members, whether CU or non-CU students, engineering undergraduates, or J.D. candidates.
									<br>
									<br>China, the most populous country in the world, has been growing at an unprecedented rate for the past several decades. Education is undoubtedly one of the greatest driving forces of the Chinese economy. Several experts have credited specialized education focusing on particular subjects and training to prepare students for the workplace for its instrumental role in China's rise. Meanwhile, others argue that if China continues with such an educational system, it will produce generations of mercenary, docile, and technically trained "machines", rather than versatile citizens capable of introspection, critical thinking, and more importantly, innovation. They claim that a liberal arts education would help nurture creativity, civic participation, and democracy among its citizens. This two-hour panel of inspiring intellectuals and prominent leaders aims to discuss questions beyond simple economic growth considerations, and to conceptualize the key elements of higher education—whether specialized or liberal arts— that would sustain the “Great China Dream.”

								<p class="chinese">随着中国经济的迅猛发展，在过去的十年间，高等院校数量增加了一倍，达到2409所；与此同时，毕业生人数也增加了四倍，预计到2020年将有1.95亿大专院校毕业生,即中国总人口的十分之一。然而，与之相对应的是与日俱增的出国留学人数。截止2013年，中国留学生总人数已达305.86万人；仅2013年一年中国就有41.29万人出国留学。海外高校先进的知识技术、多样的专业选择、多元的文化交流以及其国际化的教学视野成为中国学生渴望留学的主要因素。鉴于此，中国应如何在增加高校数量的同时也提升其教育质量？高校应如何培养出一个鼓励学生创造与创新的教育环境？而中国毕业生又如何成为国际公司冀求的人才资源，拥有国际竞争力？纵观全球教育体系，通才教育(General Education)和专才教育(Specialized Education)为两大主流模式。什么样的教育才能更好的让中国学生适应瞬息万变的现今社会？在教育资源紧缺的中国，高等教育在未来应以何种模式发展？是培养“能领兵者”，独当一面的将才？还是培养“能将将者”，统筹全局的帅才？本次教育板块，我们将邀请教育界及相关业界的领军人物，以其独特的视角聚焦中国高等教育，比较通才和专才这两大教育模式，探讨如何取海外高校之长，补中国教育之短。因地制宜，为下一个“中国梦”规划蓝图。

							<h4>The Chinese Economy: Investment Opportunities in the New Era 
</h4>
							<div class="row">
								<p>The year of 2014 has revealed the improving health of the advanced economies, with surging consumption and decreasing unemployment. In contrast, emerging markets have demonstrated tepid growth, with the Chinese economy at a major crossroads. The slowing growth in GDP has prompted Chinese firms to compete internationally and to revamp their business portfolios. The ongoing shifts in economic power have altered the global flow of capital, and international investors have become increasingly wary of investing in China. Despite unprecedented scrutiny of the Chinese market, regulations, and economic policies, the following question continues to cloud the thinking of global investors: Will China be the same profit engine that it once was? 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>The panel today consists of economists and industry leaders, who will discuss the future of the Chinese macro-economy and investment hotspots. We will examine potential effects of pending reforms on new economic models, innovations, and growth opportunities.</p>

							<h4>Chinese Enterprises: Its Path to Globalization </h4>
							<div class="row">
								<p>After 30 years of rapid economic growth since the advent of its “Reform and Opening Up Policy,” China is entering a new phase of economic transition. In a downturn, firms face increasing challenges, which will weed out weak companies in a given industry, and even entire industries that are uncompetitive. These challenges are further exacerbated by the diminishing “WTO dividends” enjoyed by China since joining the organization 10 years ago, since China first became a truly global factory. To tackle these problems and seek out new growth, Chinese firms increasingly rely upon a “Go Out Strategy”, ushering in a new era of “Chinese creation” in contrast with the “Chinese manufacturing” era of the past. Above all, the depreciation of global asset prices and the relative stability of the Chinese domestic economy since the global financial crisis have presented fascinating opportunities for cross-border acquisitions. With this global backdrop, enterprises in both the state-owned and private sectors are increasingly eager to adopt the “Go Out Strategy” and have completed numerous successful transactions. With the financial and managerial resources in China and the need for global markets and technologies, this strategy is certain to continue to blossom. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>However, with the world economy still at a crossroads and trade protectionism rearing its ugly head, how will the “Go Out Strategy” fit into the new global environment? What difficulties do Chinese firms entering the global market face? How do firms strike a balance between global and domestic markets? What are the main drivers for cross-border M&As in the next decade? The panelists will share their expertise and opinions on issues related to the global expansion of Chinese firms.

								<p class="chinese">1978年，中国实行改革开放政策。经过三十年的经济腾飞，中国经济迈入了新的转型期。在经济下行期，市场对企业的约束增强，优胜劣汰作用强化，而企业各业务板块的矛盾也充分暴露。这为中国企业带来了调结构、转方式的重要挑战。三十年的发展，中国企业积累了强大的金融实力和丰富的管理经验，以及对海外市场和先进技术的迫切需求。在这样的大环境下，除了以政府为导向的国有企业外，民营企业越来越积极地参与“走出来”战略，并且完成了很多成功的并购案例。中国企业走向海外已然是一个大趋势。如今，全球经济步入后金融危机时代。 世界经济的转型、经济格局的重新洗牌和贸易保护主义的抬头，中国的“走出去”战略又该如何适应新的经济环境？当前中国企业进入国际市场的困境有哪些？在国际化的进程中，中国企业如何平衡国际化和本土化？而未来10年终海外并购的动力又何在？带着这些问题，让我们与中国企业家，金融专家和法律专家一起对话全球，聆听中国，描绘中国企业海外拓展的新时代蓝图。

							<h4>The Breakthroughs of Modern Chinese Literature </h4>
							<div class="row">
								<p>Since the 1980s, Chinese literature has enjoyed a relatively free environment, with a broadening scope in terms of contents, an increase in production, and an expanding community of writers. In the 21st century in particular, numerous innovations can be observed in the creation and commercial distribution of literature. At the same time, the opening up of the Chinese mainland has offered the world greater exposure to Chinese literature, exemplified by the various international awards won by Chinese writers and the translation of Chinese works into foreign languages. Also exciting is the explosive growth in “Internet literature,” which has revolutionized the creation, distribution, and readership of literary works. In this new era, how should contemporary Chinese literature go about blazing new trails and seizing new opportunities? 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>What are some of the difficulties in the growth and development of contemporary Chinese literature since the 1980s? What stumbling blocks has the commercialization of Chinese works at home and abroad faced since the 2000s? What roles does Chinese literature play on the global stage? Is “Internet literature” a driving force or a hindrance to the continued development of literature as a whole? The panelists will share their outlook on and analysis of the various challenges, opportunities, and future paths that lie ahead for Chinese literature.

								<p class="chinese">从二十世纪八十年代开始，中国大陆推行改革政策，使其文学、商业都得到了相对宽松、自由的发展环境。文学作品题材更加广泛，数量大大增加，创作者人数也直线上升。这三十多年来，尤其是二零零零年以后这十余年来，中文当代文学在艺术创作和商业运作两个方面，既探索出了新的路子，又不可避免的遭遇到了种种困境。同一时间，中国大陆也因为逐步对外开放，使得中文文学获得了更多的与外部展开接触的机会。部分中文作家获得了重要的国际奖项，一些优秀的中文作品被翻译成了多国文字，中文文学因此感受到了获取其他文化社群的关注和了解的重要性。此外，随着互联网时代的来临，网络文学的疯狂蔓延，使得中文文学的创作模式、传播模式以及阅读模式都发生了革命性的变化。在这三个向度上，当代中文学应该如何突破探索路上的困境？又应该如何顺应时代趋势、利用新的机遇? 当代中文文学的突围势在必行。二十世纪八十年代以来，不同题材当代中文文学的创作、发展主要困境有哪些？二零零零年以来，中国大陆以及海外中文文学的商业运作之路有哪些困境？当代中文文学有机会在世界文学舞台上获得更大的关注度和影响力么？中国作家获得国际认可是否意味着当代中文文学的成功？网络文学的疯狂蔓延是否推动了中文文学的发展？为了就以上问题展开富有建设性的讨论，我们将邀请当代中文文学突围之路上的先行者们，分享、对话、辨析，期盼着为中华民族下一次文艺复兴的来临筚路蓝缕。

							<h4>The Chinese Media: Its Role in the World</h4>
							<div class="row">
								<p>Both the new and the traditional media have provided unencumbered access to global information and diverse opinions, but this freedom and plurality are also accompanied by confusion and chaos. Although the Chinese media industry has traditionally served the domestic market, this will soon change. In the face of an increasing global audience, how do Chinese media companies adapt to the global landscape and co-exist with the entrenched tycoons? We will discuss the opportunities and challenges the Chinese media industry faces from the perspectives of content producers, corporate managers, and media investors as Chinese media companies enter the global stage. 
                                    <br>Question 1: First-hand access to sources of global news 
                                    <br>In major global events, such as the Malaysian Airlines tragedy, how can Chinese media companies obtain news at the earliest possible moment and avoid missing out on important events? 
                                    <br>Question 2: Proliferation of cultural influence and “soft power” 
                                    <br>The producers of globally consumed entertainment are largely restricted to the U.S., Britain, Japan, and South Korea. These TV shows and films have enabled the culture of the countries in which they are produced to penetrate into countries in which they are watched. How are Chinese media companies responding to this influence and attempting to expand their own global voice and influence? 
                                    <br>Question 3: Leadership and guidance in terrorist incidents 
                                    <br>With regard to such terrorist incidents as “9/11” and the incident at the “Train Station of Kunming”, how can the media best go about appropriately reporting the facts and guiding the public to understand these events objectively without manipulating or inflaming public sentiment? 
                                    <br>Question 4: Facts or Sentiments? 
                                    <br>With regard to unexpected events, such as the earthquake in Wenchuan and the Fukushima tsunami, should the media focus on reporting the hard facts related to the disasters or focus instead on raising awareness by reporting personal stories during these events? 
                                    <br>Question 5: Global expectations for the Chinese media 
                                    <br>While the Western media has long been established, the Chinese media is still in its infancy. Armed with a wealth of experience from the Western media, China is well equipped to develop novel and distinct contents and systems of distribution. What is the current image of the Chinese media across the globe? What does the established Western media expect from the globalizing Chinese media?</p>

								<p class="chinese">毋庸置疑，无论新媒体或是传统媒介，在信息传播日益国际化的今天，都为新闻多样化、即时性开辟了一条畅通无阻之道，然而新闻传播的混乱无序也伴随而至。当代中国媒体在此特殊的历史环境下，究竟该以何种身份与世界媒体共舞？在“新闻媒体”版块中，我们希望从制作者、管理者、投资者的角度，多方面研讨中国新闻、互联网等传媒产业在当代社会背景下的国际化矛盾。 核心问题一：媒体如何在国际重大事件获取信息源 如在以马航为代表的国际重大事件中，媒体如何能够在与国际事件的对接中，主动、有效地获取一手核心新闻源，避免信息传播的混乱和媒体失语的尴尬。 核心问题二：“数据外宣”战略与各国文化影响力 当今的文化娱乐圈天下已被美剧、韩剧、英剧、日剧瓜分天下，各国更是通过各种脍炙人口的综艺节目将本国软实力文化渗透到观众，传达到世界。在此，中美国家与地方是如何具体实施，应有哪些改进呢？ 核心问题三：恐怖事件报道中的有效舆论引导 针对“911”、昆明火车站等引发的强烈反恐情绪的重大事件，媒体应当如何避免煽动，正确引导民众情绪，理智反省、冷清客观地加以批判分析。 核心问题四：突发性事件报道，以人为本还是新闻至上 近年来，世界各地包括我国突发事件接连不断，如：汶川地震、日本海啸等，对此，媒体应当客观报道、提供灾民需求渠道；还是采取“人情”报道模式，调动受众情绪，增强关注度。 核心问题五：外媒对中国媒体的印象与期待 西方媒体完整成熟，架构体系历时长久；而中国媒体起步较晚，仍处在成长与探索阶段。在借鉴西方媒体优势的同时，中国希望开创出有自己特色的优质媒体资源。那么外媒对当今中国媒体有何固有印象，对其未来的表现又有着怎样的期待？
